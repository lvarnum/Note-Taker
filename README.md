# Note Taker

## Project Description
The application works as a note taker that can create, save and delete notes. Old notes can be viewed or deleted. 

## Instructions  
Go to the deployed application at https://afternoon-beach-79300.herokuapp.com/  
Press the 'Get Started' button to start creating notes. Use the save button in the upper right corner to save any notes you wish to view later. Each note will have its own delete button so that it may be deleted at any point. Click on any old note on the left-hand side to view it. The pencil icon in the top left can be clicked to create a new note.
